# @WomeninStat: The ASA Committee on Women in Statistics RoCur  

_These were adapted from the [R-Ladies RoCur Guide](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/tree/master/RoCur-Twitter)_.

## About  
  
The **[ASA Committee on Women in Statistics RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://twitter.com/WomeninStat)** is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome member of our community in statistics or data science each week. This account is run by the Committee on Women in Statistics.      
  
   
## Objectives  
  
1. To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the Women in Statistics and Data Science community.    
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in statistics and data science.   
  
## How It Works  
  
Every week, a different person takes over our twitter account to talk about the work they do in statistics and data science. Featured curators come from a diversity of professions and have a range of experiences, from novice to expert.
