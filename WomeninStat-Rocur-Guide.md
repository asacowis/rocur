# @WomeninStat: Curator Guide  
  
_This document was adapted from the [R-Ladies RoCur Guide](https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/tree/master/RoCur-Twitter)_.
  
## About
  
The **[ASA Committee on Women in Statistics RoCur (Rotating Curation)](https://twitter.com/WomeninStat)** is a twitter handle that will feature an awesome member of our community in statistics or data science each week. This account is run by the Committee on Women in Statistics.  
  
## Objectives  
  
1. To encourage and maintain Twitter engagement within the Women in Statistics and Data Science community.    
2. To spotlight female and minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender) and their great work in statistics and data science.   
   
## How Curating Works  
  
* Curatorship begins each **Monday at 7:00 AM ET** and ends the following **Saturday at 12:00 PM ET**.   
* For the duration of the curatorship, the profile photo will be a photo of the curator. This is updated by the RoCur administrator.    
* The personal twitter handle of the curator will be in the bio (if applicable, you do not need to be a twitter user prior to curating).   
* Your first post should introduce yourself to the account followers. Your first tweet should tell the audience: what you do (your job, hobbies, etc.), and what you do in statistics / data science. You may want to pin this tweet so it stays at the top of the feed throughout the week.   
* Tweet throughout the week! We do not require that you tweet a specific number of times. But, we ask that you be as active as your schedule allows during your curatorship.  
* Every Sunday, the administrator will update access of the account for the next curator via Tweetdeck.

## Tweeting Tips  
  
### Introducing Yourself  
  
Start your curatorship by introducing yourself, what you do (your job, hobbies, etc.), and what you do in statistics / data science.   
  
Suggestions on how to introduce yourself:    
  
* Share a URL to your website or github or etc.  
* If your photo on the account differs from the photo on your personal twitter account, post the photo of your personal twitter account.  
  
  
### General Tweeting Guidelines   
  
* We do not require that you tweet a specific number of times. But, we ask that you be as active as your schedule allows during your curatorship.    
* The content of your tweets is all up to you! But keep it relevant to statistics and/or data science. Make the account and its tweets useful for learning.   
* Tweet pictures/graphics whenever possible.  
    + Please properly attribute your photos and graphics by asking permission from the source if not you and tagging the individual if able.  
    + Tag individuals who are in the photos if able.  
* Use hashtags! (See below, [Tweeting about stats/data science](#tweeting-about-stats), for more information on this)   
* Add emojis and gifs when appropriate :smile:   
* Have Fun!   
  
  
### Tweeting about Stats   
    
* Share relevant articles, blog posts, etc. relevant to your work or interests in statistics/data science.    
* Tell us something you just learned about statistics/data science.  
* Tell followers about a current statistics/data science project you are doing (share a line of code or dataviz, link to a package you use a lot).   
* If you are part of an ASA Chapter, highlight a project your local chapter is working on.  
* When mentioning an R package, add a link to its CRAN/BioConductor/GitHub page.   
    + If possible, tag the Twitter account of the maintainer if this person isn’t too famous yet (e.g. no need to link and tag Hadley Wickham when mentioning ggplot2).   
    + Same goes for courses, books, and etc.   
* Use hashtags whenever possible.  
    + Use the hashtag **#WSDS** whenever possible and relevant.  
    + Use the **#statstwitter** hashtag when you share something that can be useful for the greater stats/data science community 
  + Some other hashtag examples: **#dataviz, #rstats, #opendata**    
  + You can also hashtag: conferences, the location of your local chapter, etc.
  
  
### Interacting with your audience  
  
One goal of @WomeninStat is to maintain a strong community on Twitter! Therefore, please respond to people who interact with the account.   
  
If someone asks a question, we suggest re-tweeting their question with your response as a comment so that others can see the original question.  
  
  
*Other suggestions for interacting with your audience:*  
  
* Ask a question about something you are having trouble with in statistics / data science (our community is all about helping and supporting each other).  
* Ask for recommendations on for a project you are working on.  
* Create a twitter poll for followers to respond to. *Please note: You cannot create a twitter poll in Tweetdeck. We recommend creating a poll on your personal account and retweeting it via @WomeninStat.*
