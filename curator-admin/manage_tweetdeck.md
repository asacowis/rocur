Hi <name>, 

We are excited to have you as a Women in Statistics and Data Science Rotating Curator (RoCur) this week! We have just added your twitter handle to the @WomenInStat Tweetdeck account. If you go to http://tweetdeck.com, you should be able to see the account listed.

We will change the picture on the @WomenInStat account Sunday evening to the picture that you provided to us, tweet out an iconograph of you on Monday at 8am EST, and then will pin it to the top of the account so people know who is tweeting next week.

Please let us know if you have any questions and THANK YOU for signing up to be a RoCur. Can't wait to see all the awesome tweets!
